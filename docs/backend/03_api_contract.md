# Backend API Contract

## Status

Only the health endpoints are implemented. The resource endpoints described in the global architecture are planned.

## Base Path

Application API routes use `/api`.

## Implemented Health Endpoints

### Application Health

```http
GET /api/health
```

Current response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "backend"
}
```

### Framework Health

```http
GET /up
```

This route is Laravel's framework health route configured in `backend/bootstrap/app.php`. It is separate from the application API health response.

## Planned API Rules

- Use nouns for resource paths.
- Use HTTP methods according to their standard meaning.
- Validate every incoming payload.
- Authorize mutations independently of frontend visibility.
- Return stable JSON structures through API Resources when resources exist.
- Do not expose private storage paths.
- Mark undocumented endpoints as planned, not implemented.

## Planned Error Shape

Validation errors should use Laravel's standard structure:

```json
{
  "message": "The given data was invalid.",
  "errors": {
    "field": [
      "The field is required."
    ]
  }
}
```

Business errors should expose a stable code when implemented:

```json
{
  "message": "The record cannot be confirmed.",
  "code": "RECORD_CONFIRMATION_BLOCKED",
  "details": {
    "reason": "FINANCIAL_MISMATCH"
  }
}
```
