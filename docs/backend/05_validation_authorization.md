# Validation and Authorization

## Three Validation Boundaries

```text
HTTP validation
  -> Is the request shape and input acceptable?

Business validation
  -> Does the data obey TPVS rules?

Authorization
  -> Is this user allowed to perform this action?
```

Do not replace one boundary with another.

## HTTP Validation

Use Laravel Form Requests for endpoint payloads. Validate types, required fields, formats, limits, file properties, and relationships before calling an application workflow.

## Business Validation

Business validators must enforce the rules in `docs/02_business_rules_and_states.md`, including financial consistency, state transitions, confirmed-only reporting, delivery cash reconciliation, and human confirmation.

Backend calculations are authoritative. AI values are input for review, never official financial truth.

## Authorization Status

Editor and Viewer roles are planned and not implemented in the current backend.

| Action | Editor | Viewer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| View records and reports | Yes | Yes |
| Create or upload | Yes | No |
| Edit, confirm, or cancel | Yes | No |
| Prepare delivery | Yes | No |
| Generate reports | Yes | Yes |

Implement resource permissions with Laravel Policies and verify both allowed and forbidden behavior with feature tests.
